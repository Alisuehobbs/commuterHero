Q1 Project Write-Up

What's the name of your project?
Cool Commute

What problem does it solve?
Cool Commute provides awareness of the impact of commuting by driving alone every day on climate change.

Who has this problem?
Climate change is everyone’s problem. It needs to be address on a global level, but individuals can make an impact by making small changes in their lifestyle. One of these is changing their commute.

How does your project solve this problem?
My project shows how much individuals can save by changing their commute to walking, biking, or taking public transportation in just one month. It shows how many gallons of gas are saved, how much money is saved, and how much CO2 is saved from entering the atmosphere if they switched from driving alone to alternative transportation. It also provides perspective by highlighting the fact that this is one person’s impact.

What web APIs did it use?
Google Maps API

What technologies did it use?
JavaScript, CSS, Materialize, Google Maps API

What was the most valuable piece of Customer feedback you received?
The most valuable, and difficult to solve, piece of feedback I received had to do with the overall relevance of the project. I had a great statistics, but the CO2 statistic wasn’t meaningful. I had to add perspective to the number for it to be impactful.
What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome?

My biggest challenge was making the AJAX call to the Google Maps API. It didn’t work the way we learned in class and the documentation was hard to understand.
